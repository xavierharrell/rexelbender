#My Personal Site

Here's my site pre CraftCMS implementation.

I’ve used methods that have helped grow as a developer and allows me to quickly iterate designs.

Here are some of the resources:

[Sass Guidelines](http://sass-guidelin.es/) **Kept me sane.** Easier to make changes when everything is in modules.

[Gulp Starter](https://github.com/greypants/gulp-starter) I can’t stress how great it is to have this in modules. So much easier to add and take workflows.

I will keep making changes. I also need to do some cleanup and make better comments around some of the functionality I’ve built.
